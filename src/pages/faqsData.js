        title: "WILL JOINING A FRATERNITY IMPACT MY EDUCATION?",
        content: "One of Lambda Phi Epsilon's core and founding purposes is to promote academic achievement. Like any commitment, joining a fraternity will require time and effort, but managing school and joining a fraternity is definitely possible. As fellow students, the brothers of Lambda Phi Epsilon will also be committed to helping you achieve academic responsibility and success. Our info sessions will provide more details with time-commitments and management, but the best estimate would be relating the initiation process to a 3-hour credit course."
